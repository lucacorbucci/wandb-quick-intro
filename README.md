# wandb-quick-intro

This is a repository that contains some examples of how I use Weights & Biases to track the experiments of my machine learning projects.

The repository is organized in the following way:
- The notebook `setup_wandb.ipynb` that contains a quick introduction to Weights & Biases, how to initialize it and how to log some metrics.
- The notebook `train_model.ipynb` contains an example of how to train a model logging the metrics to Weights & Biases.
- The notebook `plots.ipynb` contains an example of how to use the Weights & Biases API to plot the results of the experiments.
- The folder hyp_tuning contains an example of how to use a "Sweep" to tune hyperparameters with Weights & Biases.
