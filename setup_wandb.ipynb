However, in some cases it can be difficult to give a meaning to the \"step\" parameter. My suggestion is to specify at logging time what will be the \"x\" axis of our plot. For instance, if we are logging the loss of a model during training, we can specify the \"epoch\" as the \"x\" axis of the plot. This can be done by adding the \"epoch\" as a key of the dictionary passed to the `wandb.log()` function with the value of the epoch as the value of the key.\n",
